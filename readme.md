# Image Carousel
This was my first attempt at an image carousel. It was one of the homework assignments from General Assembly.

## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript, jQuery

I used a series of IF/ELSE statements in the JS to add and remove classes to show multiple images.

## Optimizations

As this was my first image carousel, I was very happy to get it to work. There is certainly some refactoring that can be done to make the JS more streamlined. An example of a more efficient image carousel of mine can be found on my travel blog: https://github.com/saraen7/travelBlog.

## Lessons Learned:

I did the extra portion of this assignment to include image scoring as well and really learned the importance of debugging throughout the process.
